This mod enables configuration for the traders (Haldor) available wares.

See the [Valheim wiki](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Wiki/wiki/ObjectDB-Table) to get a list of item names which can be used.

All changes are done at run-time. Any changes to trader will go back to default if the mod is uninstalled, or the configurations disabled.

This mod does not add support for configuring the selling of items (any item that has value can be sold, modifying the value in item data would allow this).

## Trader Wares  

'sell_that.selling.cfg'

Trader items are configured by creating a section as follows:

``` INI
[<Some-Unique-Section-Name>]
ItemName = <ItemPrefabName>
Order = <int> //Tries to insert based in traders list based on this. If -1 (or other negative number), it will be added somewhere at the end.
Price = <int> //Price of the item
StackSize = <int> //Number of items to get pr buy
Enabled = <bool> //Can be disabled without deletion.
```

The file comes pre-defined with all existing trader wares.

Multiple entries of the same item can be done by simply choosing a different section name

## Example

``` INI
[Iron Scrap One]
ItemName = IronScrap
Order = 0
Price = 100
StackSize = 1
Enabled = true

[Iron Scrap Two]
ItemName = IronScrap
Order = 1
Price = 500
StackSize = 5
Enabled = true

```

# Changelog

Fixed out of bounds when trying to insert with Order higher than number of items already available.
