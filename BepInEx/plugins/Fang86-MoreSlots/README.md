It appears all item loss bugs have been fixed - however, use this at your own risk!

# More Slots
This mod adds more rows into your inventory. You can change this to any number you want over 4. By default, the mod adds 2 rows (16 slots).

It is recommended you don't exceed 8 slots for the time being as the bug fix may only fully support 8 rows at the moment.

Make sure you don't remove this mod while items are still in the extra rows as they will be lost.


## Manual Installation
In order to install this mod, `you need to have BepInEx and Harmony installed`. After installing these, place `moreslots.dll` (extract zip) into `(Your Steam games directory)\Valheim\BepInEx\plugins`.

## Config
Before the config file is generated, you must run the game with the mod installed.

To edit the number of rows in your inventory go to `(Your Steam games directory)\Valheim\BepInEx\config` and open `fastferment.cfg` in notepad. Then change the number after the "=" sign. Changing this below 4 may have unintended consequences, so I would recommend setting it to a number >= 4.

## Planned additions
- Add craftable backpacks
- Increase number of chest slots
