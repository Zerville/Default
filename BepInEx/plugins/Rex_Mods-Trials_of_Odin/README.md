# Trials of Odin: A Difficulty Enhancement Mod

This mod was created to increase the difficulty, add some mechanics, and make Valheim dangerous again!

## Implemented Features:

### Base Features

- Configurable boss scaling that :
  - Takes a value from the config, and uses that to overwrite the default game scaling.
  - Scaling is applied to health, damage, and movement speed.
  - Scaling is also based on number of players. Higher player count around boss spawn = much harder bosses.
  - Optional config to force scaling to set number of players.
- Toggleable boss rage mode that increases boss attack frequency below half health.
- Toggleable increased base enemy difficulty. Raises every mob difficulty by 1 level, but does not increase loot. **_As of V1.1.1, Enemies have a 60% chance of spawning lvl 2-4, 30% chance of spawning 5-7, and 10% chance of spawning 8-10. Loot is based on those "Tiers" that they fall into. Max loot that can be dropped is that of a 2\* enemy._**

### Event System

- Toggleable Event System Overhaul: Events can now be bound to the player so that they only receive events they've "unlocked"

### Iron Man Mode

- Toggleable Iron Man Mode: Once your character dies, you get logged out & that character is deleted forever. Try a true Iron Man Run!
- Toggleable Iron Man Lite: Once your character dies, instead of being deleted, inventory is destroyed & stats are reset to zero. At least you get to keep your base?
- Toggleable World Breaker Mode: **ONLY** for the hardcore. On death, logs you out, deletes your character & your world. **HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
- Iron Man Mode must be enabled for Iron Man Lite or World Breaker to function.

## Planned Features

- Allow bosses to spawn their corresponding events during boss fights.
- Increase portal construction cost to add 5 Bronze Bars.
- Anything else **_sadistic_** I can come up with, or that you recommend!

- **V1.0.3**: Updated Changelog incorrectly. Reflected appropriately now.
- **V1.0.2**: Added checks for whether host or not on a lot of things. Also WorldBreaker now checks if total players is 1 and if it is enabled it will delete the world. **STILL DO NOT RECOMMEND USING ON SERVER**.
